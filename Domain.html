            In mathematics, the <strong>domain</strong> of a function is the complete set of possible values of the independent variable. In simpler terms, it is the set of all input values (x-values) for which the function is defined.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, consider the function f(x) = 1/x. The domain of this function is all real numbers except x = 0, because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, the domain can be expressed as:
        </p>
        <p>
            Domain: { x ∈ ℝ | x ≠ 0 }
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding the domain of a function is crucial for analyzing its behavior and ensuring that calculations are valid.
