            <dd>Computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. It encompasses the design of the central processing unit (CPU), memory hierarchy, input/output mechanisms, and data paths. The goal of computer architecture is to optimize performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness while meeting the requirements of various applications.</dd>
            <dt><b>The Second Paragraph</b></dt>
            <dd>Key components of computer architecture include the instruction set architecture (ISA), which defines the set of instructions that a computer can execute; the microarchitecture, which describes how the ISA is implemented in hardware; and the system architecture, which encompasses the overall design of the computer system, including memory, storage, and peripheral devices. Advances in computer architecture have led to significant improvements in processing power, energy efficiency, and overall system performance.</dd>
